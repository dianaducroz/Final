<p>Almost 2,500 buildings were demolished in Manhattan in the last decade, according to permit data from NYC Department of Buildings. 
	The highest numbers of demolitions – almost half of the total - occurred in Midtown, followed by Lower Manhattan.</p>  

<p>In an already built-out urban area, demolition is typically the first step towards new construction and therefore provides a clue 
	to local redevelopment trends. The number of demolition permits issued is not a perfect measure of new buildings constructed, 
	since some new buildings are built on vacant lots and some permitted demolitions are never carried out.</p>

	<p>Whereas the impact of new buildings on a neighborhood is visible, demolition of existing buildings can disturb more than just the dirt underneath. Demolition of occupied structures displaces businesses and residents, disrupting the social fabric.</p> 

<p>Many buildings have cultural, historic, and sentimental value apart from their objective monetary value, and losing a beloved building can have an emotional impact, although this is harder to quantify.</p>


<p>Demolition also carries an environmental burden. Demolition debris accounted for 90% of the 548 million tons of construction-related waste in 2015, according to data published by the EPA on its website.ngs, would reveal more about the nature of the change to a specific community.</p></article>

<p>Apart from positive or negative consequences of new development, neighborhoods with higher numbers of demolitions for new construction will experience more social and physical disruption, at least for the period of construction itself.</p>

<article><p>East Harlem is just one Manhattan neighborhood undergoing ‘gentrification’ pressure as new buildings go up and new residents move in.  
	East Midtown is already more densely developed but it too is undergoing new construction. But just how many buildings have disappeared in the last decade, and how many new ones built?</p>
